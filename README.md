================================================

IncludeOS is an includable, minimal [unikernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel) operating system for C++ services running in the cloud. Starting a program with `#include <os>` will literally include a tiny operating system into your service during link-time.

The build system will:
* link your service with the necessary OS objects into a single binary
* attach a boot loader
* combine everything into a self-contained bootable disk image, ready to run on almost any modern hypervisor.

IncludeOS is free software, with "no warranties or restrictions of any kind".

**Note:** *IncludeOS is under active development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.*

### Key features

* **Extreme memory footprint**: A minimal bootable image, including bootloader, operating system components and a complete C++ standard library is currently 707K when optimized for size.
* **KVM and VirtualBox support** with full virtualization, using [x86 hardware virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization), available on any modern x86 CPUs). In principle IncludeOS should run on any x86 hardware platform, even on a physical x86 computer, given appropriate drivers. Officially, we develop for- and test on [Linux KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page), which power the [OpenStack IaaS cloud](https://www.openstack.org/), and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), which means that you can run your IncludeOS service on both Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.
* **C++11/14 support**
    * Full C++11/14 language support with [clang](http://clang.llvm.org) v3.8 and later.
    * Standard C++ library (STL) [libc++](http://libcxx.llvm.org) from [LLVM](http://llvm.org/).
    * Exceptions and stack unwinding (currently using [libgcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Libgcc.html)).
    * *Note:* Certain language features, such as threads and filestreams are currently missing backend support.
* **Standard C library** using [newlib](https://sourceware.org/newlib/) from [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/).
* **Virtio Network driver** with DMA. [Virtio](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=virtio) provides a highly efficient and widely supported I/O virtualization. We are working towards the new [Virtio 1.0 OASIS standard](http://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.0/virtio-v1.0.html)
* **A highly modular TCP/IP-stack**.

## Getting started

### Install libraries

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS
    $ cd IncludeOS
    $ sudo ./install.sh
```

Or if you are running Arch Linux (or one of its flavors):

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS
    $ cd IncludeOS
    $ ./install.sh
```

**The script will:**

* Install the required dependencies: `curl make clang-3.8 nasm bridge-utils qemu`.
* Download the latest binary release bundle from github.
* Unzip the bundle to `$INCLUDEOS_INSTALL_LOC` (defaults to `$HOME`).
* Create a network bridge called `include0`, for tap-networking.
* Build the vmbuilder, which turns your service into a bootable image.
* Copy `vmbuild` and `qemu-ifup` from the repo, over to `$INCLUDEOS_HOME`.

**NOTE:** The script will install packages, and thus will require sudo access.

Detailed installation instructions for [Vagrant](https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS/wiki/Vagrant), [OS X](https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS/wiki/OS-X) and [Ubuntu](https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS/wiki/Ubuntu) are available in the Wiki, as well as instructions for [building everything from source](https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS/wiki/Ubuntu#b-completely-build-everything-from-source-slow).

### Testing the installation

A successful setup enables you to build and run a virtual machine. Running:

```
    $ ./test.sh
```

will build and run [this example service](./examples/demo_service/service.cpp).

More information is [available on the wiki](https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS/wiki/Testing-the-example-service).

### Writing your first service

1. Copy the [./seed](./seed) directory to a convenient location like `~/your_service`. Then, just start implementing the `Service::start` function in the `Service` class, located in [your_service/service.cpp](./seed/service.cpp) (Very simple example provided). This function will be called once the OS is up and running.  
2. Enter the name of your service in the first line of the [seed Makefile](./seed/Makefile). This will be the base for the name of the final disk image.

**Example:**

```
    $ cp -r seed ~/my_service
    $ cd ~/my_service
    $ emacs service.cpp
    ... add your code
    $ make
    $ ./run.sh my_service.img
```

Take a look at the [examples](./examples) and the [tests](./test). These all started out as copies of the same seed.
